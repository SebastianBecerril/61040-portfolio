# Assignment 1: Problem Framing

## Domains

### **Fraternity Life - Chosen**
Being in a fraternity has played a great part in my social, academic, and personal development in college. I enjoy spending time with my fellow brothers through casual hangouts, supporting each other academically, and helping the fraternity grow by being involved with our inner logistics and formal events. Although not as involved as I used to be, I still like to help out whenever I can and offer my point of view as a senior by being a mentor to my underclassmen. Particularly, I would like for our organization to be more organized in many different aspects of how we run things and have members take more accountability and initiative.

### **Fashion - Chosen**
Since I started college, I started to take more of an interest in fashion and how I outwardly present myself, as I believe it can be a great form of self-expression and help with self-confidence. I enjoy browsing through the internet and taking inspiration from those around me to shape my own style that I feel most comfortable in. However, it can be a struggle for me to figure out what clothes or accessories I want to buy, what outfits I can put together, and ultimately determine if what I come up with can actually translate into something I like in real life. This interest of mine is both a rewarding and frustrating hobby that I have to learn how to better deal with and balance.

### **Cooking - Chosen**
Cooking is arguably my biggest recreational interest. Not only do I love to cook, but above all, I love learning about cooking. I find it fascinating to learn about formal theory and culinary techniques, interesting recipes that I find online and in books, and about the thousands of restaurants in the world. I particularly enjoy traveling to different places and experiencing the cuisine there, whether it’s fine dining or street food. For me, the essence of cooking is to try as many different things as you can, but one of the problems that can come with this is not being overwhelmed by the seemingly endless choices that there can be.

### Wrestling
My interest lies in watching professional wrestling/sports entertainment (WWE, AEW, TNA, not actual Olympic-style wrestling), learning more about different wrestling styles/moves/markets, and discussing with other people about the medium.

### Living With Roommates
Dealing with logistics like chores or supply inventory, spending social time with my roommates, and communicating about living space-related matters like having guests over or knowing who is home at what time.

### Reading Books
Reading fiction and non-fiction books, discussing with others about the intricate details or nuances of the book, and browsing for new and interesting genres.

### Anime
Watching anime across different genres, keeping an organized list and rating of what I have watched, and having chats about theoretical/abstract aspects of the shows.

### Job Search
Staying up to date with the best practices of how to stay competitive in the market, keeping track of job postings, and interview/technical preparation.

### Concerts
Going to concerts with friends who are interested in the same groups, searching for future concerts that might be in my area that align with my music taste, and finding the best deals for tickets and experiences.

### Current Events
Keeping up with the current world problems that are most relevant to my life, being informed about candidates that are up for election to make the most educated choice, and overall being knowledgeable about the state of our society.

## Problems

### Fraternity Life

#### **Staying Academically Connected to Brothers - Selected**
This problem includes knowing which classes brothers are taking, which classes they have taken in the past and are knowledgeable in, as well as the specific schedule they have and academic extracurriculars they are a part of. This problem is often tackled by either having a spreadsheet at the beginning of the semester that brothers fill out or having multiple Slack messages of people asking “Who is taking X class?” This is often not very efficient, as people’s schedules can drastically change after the first week, messages can get lost, or people may know a class another is taking but not the version or section they are in. Overall, this is an issue of disorganization that ends up in a lack of awareness and information available. I selected this problem because this is a genuine issue that I have dealt with as a scholarship chair in my fraternity and one in which every member in the fraternity could benefit from a solution. Its feasibility is also not out of reach, with similar problems (yet still different) being solved by applications like Hydrant and CourseRoad.

#### Tracking Brother Participation and Engagement
I chose not to select this problem because there already exist good ways to keep track of attendance and activity, such as spreadsheets, Slack messaging, etc.

#### Connecting With Alumni
I chose not to select this problem because I don’t necessarily think this is a problem that is big enough to develop a whole solution dedicated to it. Existing alumni databases and social media like LinkedIn already have the capability of addressing this.

### Fashion

#### **Finding Customized Outfit Ideas - Selected**
I personally often struggle with finding outfit ideas that fit my personal style, body type, and the clothes that I have in my closet. In order to get inspiration, I usually will just do a quick Google search of the type “black shirt grey pants outfit men.” However, the majority of pictures or sites I see I either don’t like or don’t think they would look good on me. Even if I make my query more specific, it still leads to a lot of time spent scrolling through sites like Pinterest or Google Images. I selected this problem because every time I go through this process, I feel like there has to be a way less time-consuming and more direct way of searching for ideas that fit my taste. With fashion being a rapidly growing area on the internet and social media, a solution for this problem could very well be easily adapted and embraced by many.

#### **Wardrobe Management and Optimization - Selected**
A prevalent fashion-related issue I deal with is that I will cycle through the same clothes every week even though I have a whole wardrobe of clothes. Most of the time it is either just a matter of convenience since the clothes are easily accessible or the fact that I am too lazy to look through my closet and put new outfit ideas together. I can also be very disorganized at times, not knowing if I threw away a piece I am looking for or if it is just stashed in a storage box. I selected this problem because it is an issue that has become more noticeable for me as I have been in college and one that I don’t think would require an extremely complex or high-maintenance solution.

#### Translation Between Online and Real Life of Clothing Purchases
I chose not to select this problem because it would be too complex to create an accurate solution for it. There is a vast range of human height, weight, and physiology; therefore, it would be nearly impossible to concretely determine how something a person buys online will actually look on them once they wear it in real life.

### Cooking

#### Deciding Whether an Online or Viral Recipe Is Worth Cooking
I chose not to select this problem because online content already has a built-in “approval” system in the form of likes and comments. In the majority of cooking videos, there are often comments stating if a recipe is tasty, complicated, or too expensive.

#### Discovering New Restaurants
I chose not to select this problem because there already exist dedicated services that focus specifically on this purpose. For example, Beli and Yelp, to an extent.

#### Keeping Track of Ingredients and Equipment
I chose not to select this problem because I don’t think most people care enough about this to have an established system for this issue. Most people just notice if they don’t have ingredients that they need or if they want to buy a new piece of equipment, they just purchase it or look for an alternative. It would not be very realistic to think that people would adopt a solution to a problem that is not that complicated.

## Stakeholders

### Staying Academically Connected to Brothers
**Brother** (the user who shares their classes and views others’); **Scholarship Chair** (officer who keeps track of how brothers are doing in their classes and how they interact with each other academically); **Professors/TAs** (teach and administer the classes that brothers are taking); **University/IFC** (administrators who keep track of academic performance of fraternities and students).  
**Impacts:** Brothers can perform better academically and feel more supported knowing which classes their fellow members have taken and their proficiency in them. The scholarship chair is able to better keep track of brother academic performance and create plans for continued academic growth within the fraternity. Professors/TAs are interested in seeing better performance from their students and can have a reduced workload if students receive support from others taking the class. University/IFC can have a favorable outlook toward the fraternity seeing that members take academic growth and performance seriously as part of a fraternity’s values.

### Finding Customized Outfit Ideas
**Outfit Creator** (the user who looks for outfit ideas and uses them to create outfits); **Outfit Sharer** (user who shares outfit ideas); **Friend** (someone who notices the user’s outfits); **Brands** (entities that sell the clothes that are parts of outfits being shared and worn).  
**Impacts:** Outfit sharers and creators go hand in hand, being able to improve their sense of style, confidence, and presentation through the sharing and improvement of outfit ideas. Friends of the outfit sharer/creator can not only take inspiration from their change or improvement in style, but may also improve the user’s confidence in their own image. Brands might be affected by certain demographics of users being drawn in or pushed away from their product due to the outfits/styles that are popular.

### Wardrobe Management and Optimization
**Owner** (user who owns all the clothing in their wardrobe); **Housemate** (someone who lives with the owner); **Financial Partner** (someone who pays or aids in paying for the owner’s clothes); **Receivers** (entities that serve as an outlet or destination for clothes that the owner wants to get rid of).  
**Impacts:** The owner is most impacted being in ownership of all their clothing, feeling wasteful or insecure by not using all their clothes. Housemates can be impacted by the space that the owner’s clothes take or the time they may spend on a clothing-related task like laundry. Financial partners can be negatively affected by buying clothes for the owner that are not being used and can be seen as a waste. Donation takers can be benefited by owners donating clothes they no longer need or want.

This finding demonstrates that an organized academic support system within fraternities can have great benefits to all parties involved—brothers, fraternities, and the university itself.
- **[The Benefits of Friendships in Academic Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis — PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10800095/):** The presence of friends and acquaintances in academic settings not only has a positive impact on grades, but also on the mental health of students.

Taking Turns, Working With Friends May Improve Grades | UW News](https://www.washington.edu/news/2017/09/25/group-project-taking-turns-working-with-friends-may-improve-grades/):** Not only do group activity and studying aid students in their class performance, but having balanced roles and good connections in said groups is also necessary. Not having people you properly connect with in group activities or collective studying can lead to negative impacts on students across many facets of their college life.
- **[The 5 Big Benefits of Studying With Friends (Including How It Could Save You Money) | Torrens University](https://www.torrens.edu.au/stories/blog/student-life/the-5-big-benefits-of-studying-with-friends-and-how-it-could-save-you-money):** This article also discusses the many benefits of feeling academically supported by your social circle. It also places a small emphasis on the struggle of first-year students finding friends in their class; a point that lends itself to how joining a community that prioritizes academic growth can be of great help.
- **[How Do I Schedule Classes With Friends? — CGH](https://collegegranthub.com/student-questions/how-do-i-schedule-classes-with-friends/):** There are many considerations to think about when planning what classes to take with your friends.

This can lead to inefficiency in work, disorganization, and ideas getting lost. Thus, this suggests that different needs may sometimes require different platforms so that everything has its own place in an organization’s workflow.
- **[A Systematic Review of the Literature Describing the Outcomes of Near-Peer Mentoring Programs for First Year Medical Students | BMC Medical Education](https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-018-1195-1):** Although more focused on medical students, this paper greatly explores how mentoring—particularly aimed at new students—is of great use for students.

- **[MIT OpenGrades](https://opengrades.mit.edu/):** OpenGrades is a tool where students can share their personal experiences that they have had with different classes at MIT.

- **[Hydrant](https://hydrant.mit.edu/):** Hydrant is a tool used by MIT students to view all the schedule configurations for an individual’s classes that they are taking in a given semester. It has many useful features like class search and a list of class times and locations, but is focused on individual planning rather than group coordination.

## Features

### Staying Academically Connected to Brothers

#### Shared Class List and Schedule
A class list database that is shared across the whole organization. You can see who is taking which class each semester, the recitation section that they are in for that class, as well as brothers who have taken the class before. Each member can update their schedule throughout the semester, and if anyone drops or switches sections, this is automatically reflected on the shared class list. This feature can also allow the scholarship chair to keep track of all the classes that everyone is taking and manage accordingly.

#### Interactive Help Board
Brothers can post questions or comments on a shared board that all brothers can see. Each post can have a tag with the intent of the query, whether it is for a specific class or a general academic question. Additionally, each post acts like a thread, with other brothers responding directly. This also serves as a way for the scholarship chair to address any academic concerns and support brothers in a more general and accessible way.

#### Individual Course Hubs
Each course that has brothers in it has its own dedicated hub/portal. This hub can include different things such as written notes, study materials, and links to external group chats or resources. Brothers can also make class-specific posts that do not belong on the help board, such as scheduling group study sessions or coordinating group projects.

### Finding Customized Outfit Ideas

#### Personalized User Profile
Outfit creators input all the information that they deem relevant to their fashion or style preferences. This can include height, weight, measurements, typical sizes, and any other specific information. This information is used to tailor outfit ideas to the specific preferences of the user.

#### Recommendation-Enhanced Wish List
Outfit creators can make a list of clothing pieces or accessories they want to purchase. These can then be taken into account to create possible outfit ideas that align with the user’s preferences. This list also contains recommendations that can be added to the wish list. These recommendations are pieces that fit the profile of the user and align and/or **complement** other items in their wish list.

#### Outfit Inspiration Board
Based on the user’s profile, style, and wish list, there exists a board with different outfit ideas or specific items that fit the user’s taste. The board can include outfits that Outfit Sharers with similar profiles to the user’s, pieces in Outfit Sharers’ wish list that fit the user’s style, and even more abstract elements, such as color palettes or styles.

### Wardrobe Management and Optimization

#### Wardrobe Inventory
A list of all the items in the wardrobe of the user. The owner of the wardrobe can input as little or as much information as they want (ranging from just the type of clothing and color to the specific item and date of purchase). The more information a user inputs, the more recommendations the application can give to the user on decisions related to their wardrobe.

#### Outfit Log and Wear Tracker
Users can select items from their wardrobe inventory to log the outfit(s) they use in a day. This information can then be used to track the user’s most used items compared to the user’s least used items. This data can then be used to recommend the user donate items that they do not show an interest in or, on the other hand, recommend outfit ideas that users can take into account to switch up the use of their favorite items.

#### Resale/Donate Hub
A hub where users can not only see nearby donation centers to donate their unused clothes, but also list clothes they want to sell and see listings of other users doing the same. This system allows flexibility for people who want to get rid of clothes quickly by just donating, or who don’t mind waiting to receive something in exchange for their clothes. It also serves as a way for receivers to obtain clothes from others in different ways that prevent clothes from just being thrown out.
